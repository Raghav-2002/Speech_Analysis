# Amplitude Modulation Analysis Module

The amplitude modulation analysis module for **Python 3**, provides functions to compute and visualize the frequency-frequency-domain representation of real-valued signals. The **MATLAB-Octave** version of this module can be found here: [https://github.com/MuSAELab/amplitude-modulation-analysis-toolbox](https://github.com/MuSAELab/amplitude-modulation-analysis-toolbox)

The module includes a GUI implementation, which facilitates the amplitude modulation analysis by allowing changing parameters on line.

In summary, the frequency-frequency representation of a signal is computed by performing two transformations.

Signal processing steps involved in the calculation of the modulation spectrogram from the amplitude spectrogram of signal. The block |abs| indicates the absolute value, and the FT indicates the use of the Fourier transform.

This module provides two implementations for the time to time-frequency transformation (*First Transformation*), one based on the STFFT, and the other on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) using the Complex Morlet wavelet. The time-frequency to frequency-frequency transformation (*Second Transformation*) is carried out with the FFT.

## Installation
Dowload or clone the respository, then:
`$ pip install .`

## Examples
Besides the functions to compute and visualize the frequency-frequency representation of real signals, example data and scripts are provided.

### Example 1: `example_01.py`
This example shows the usage and the commands accepted by GUI to explore amplitude modulation for a example ECG and EEG data. The GUI can be called with the functions:
`explore_strfft_am_gui()` which uses STFFT, and `explore_wavelet_am_gui()` based on wavelet transformation. Further details in their use refer to the comments in `example_01.py`.
